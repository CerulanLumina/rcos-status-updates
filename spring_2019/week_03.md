## Last Week's Accomplishments
 - Worked on building out the Angular component and service needed
 - Fleshed out the UI by switching from mockup data to the service
 - Implemented Graphiti calls to fetch valid terms
## This Week's Plan

Continue working on the term switcher. It's taking longer than I had hoped but
I am learning more about the specifics of Angular (I had dealt with primarily AngularJS in the past, which is essentially a legacy version)

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing I shouldn't be able to resolve myself.
