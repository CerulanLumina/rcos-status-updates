## Last Week's Accomplishments
 - Researched the Observable pattern for allowing the listing and selector components to subscribe to changes to the selected term
 - Designed a new plan for a more robust solution for the term selector using observables 

## This Week's Plan

 - Implement the plan involving observables to actually make the term selector work

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing I shouldn't be able to resolve myself.
