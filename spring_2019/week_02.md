## Last Week's Accomplishments

I finally got an issue involving my development environment fixed after
discussing with other members of the team, and have finally been able to
work on my assigned issue. I've set up the UI, and moved the mockup code
from the header component to its own component that the header now references.
I then began work on an Angular service to cache the currently selected term.
## This Week's Plan

I will finish up the Angular service and integrate it with the components. Then,
I'll finish up the issue by setting up the whole component/service to work with
the rest of the front-end.

## Anything Blocking?

I'll likely need to ask a mentor or teammate how to force the data to refresh when
the selected term is changed.
