## Last Week's Accomplishments

I collaborated with my team members to get set up to develop YACS. I made some progress on the UI portion of
the issue I have been working on (to add a term selector to YACS).

## This Week's Plan

I will finish integrating the UI and move on to the service to actually make the UI functional. Then I hope
to conduct a11y testing and complete the issue.

## Anything Blocking?

I'll likely need some help properly integrating the UI with the rest of the Angular. Although I'm not entirely
new to Angular, the YACS project is much larger than most of the things I've worked on in the past and I'm
still learning my way around the project.
