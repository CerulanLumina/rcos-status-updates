## Last Week's Accomplishments
 - Fixed an issue with my development environment
 - Fixed an old code issue occurring with term selector (removed feature was still referenced)
 - continue refactoring selection service
## This Week's Plan

 - Continue implementing the refactored service

## Anything Blocking?

Had an issue with development environment preventing testing of my code, was ~~magically~~ fixed during weekly Hangouts meeting.

Still will need to consult with developers that have worked on other dependent components
to figure out what functionality needs to be maintained and what can be shifted around.
